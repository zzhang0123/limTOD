# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-06

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed `TODsim` class to `TODSim` for better Python naming conventions
- Renamed old `limTODsim` class references to `TODSim` throughout codebase
- Updated all import statements and class instantiations to use `TODSim`
- Updated `__init__.py` and `__all__` exports to reflect new class name

### Improved

- üìù **Documentation Structure**: Moved "Latest Updates" section from README.md to dedicated CHANGELOG.md file
- üìã **Table of Contents**: Updated README.md Table of Contents to accurately reflect document structure
- üîß **Code Organization**: Improved consistency in class naming across all files including:
  - Source code (`simulator.py`)
  - Package exports (`__init__.py`)
  - Documentation (`README.md`)
  - Example notebooks (`examples.ipynb`, `mm_example.ipynb`)
  - Change Log (`CHANGELOG.md`)

### Fixed

- Corrected all references to use consistent `TODSim` class name
- Fixed import statements in example notebooks and documentation

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added

- üéØ **Full Stokes Support**: Added complete polarization handling (I, Q, U, V) for both TOD simulation and map-making
- üó∫Ô∏è **Map-Making Pipeline**: Implemented `HPW_mapmaking` class combining high-pass filtering and Wiener filtering for sky reconstruction from TOD
- üé≤ **Gaussian Random Field Generator**: Added generator for correlated sky realizations from frequency-frequency angular power spectra C_‚Ñì(ŒΩ,ŒΩ'), enabling realistic simulation of line intensity mapping signals with spectral correlations (credit: Katrine Alice Glasscock, Philip Bull)
- üìì **Example Notebooks**: Added comprehensive Jupyter notebook demonstrating the full map-making workflow ([examples/mm_example.ipynb](examples/mm_example.ipynb))

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `beam_func` and `sky_func` now require keyword-only arguments, two of which must be `freq` and `nside`:

  ```python
  # Old: beam_func(freq, nside) and sky_func(freq, nside)
  # New: beam_func(freq=xx, nside=xx) and sky_func(freq=xx, nside=xx)
  ```

- **BREAKING**: Function outputs must be HEALPix maps with specific shapes:
  - 1D array of length npix for unpolarized (**I**) beam/sky
  - 2D array of shape (3, npix) for polarized (**I, Q, U**) beam/sky
  - 2D array of shape (4, npix) for polarized (**I, Q, U, V**) beam/sky

### Fixed

- üêõ **Bug Fix**: Corrected a critical sign error in coordinate rotation transformations

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-01

### Initial Release

- Initial release of limTOD: Time-Ordered Data simulation for single-dish radio telescopes

- Support for asymmetric beam patterns
- Direct beam convolution using HEALPix spherical harmonics rotation and sum to calculate Tsky
- Flexible beam and sky model functions
- Global Sky Model (GDSM) integration
- MPI parallelization support
- Example scanning patterns and beam models
- Example notebooks for getting started
- Documentation and examples
